## About

Can't decide what to eat? Spin the slot-machine reel and let fate pick.

- **32 dishes** — the reel draws from every one of them.
- **Six world cuisines** — the dishes span six cuisines around the world.

Quick, fun, and runs on any device.

---

## Features

Let the reel decide your next meal.

### 🔨 Project Foundation

- Monorepo scaffold following the lingo app conventions
  (`packages/app/hybrid/food-drink/fdr`)
- Next.js static export validated against Tauri's `out` expectations
- Tauri desktop shell boots and loads the exported Next.js build
- Shared design system: DaisyUI `fdr` theme (light default) with `fdr-dark`
  toggle, base layout, navigation shell
- CI: lint, typecheck, build web export, build Tauri desktop artifact
- Unit test coverage thresholds enforced at 80% global

### 🏠 Home & Navigation

- Card grid listing the Food Randomizer tool with icon and description
- Tool route rendered directly, opened from the home card grid
- Theme toggle in template header; choice persisted in localStorage

### 🎰 Food Randomizer

- Slot-machine style reel cycling dish names while spinning
- 32 dishes across six cuisines: Italy, Korea, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam and
  Mexico (`randomizer/constants.ts`)
- Cuisine picker with search, cuisine filter chips and expandable groups;
  supports locking a single dish before spinning
- Spin via button or keyboard (Space / Enter); ignored while typing
- Landed dishes link to a Google search for quick research
- How-to-play modal explaining the flow
- Local spin counter shown under the reel

### 📁 Data Model

- `Cuisine { emoji, value, label }` and `Food { emoji, value, label, category }`
- `FOOD_OPTIONS` maps every cuisine plus `all` to dish label lists used by the
  reel animation and random pick

---

## First run

- **macOS:** Right-click the `.dmg` → "Open" to bypass Gatekeeper, then drag the
  app to your Applications folder.
- **Linux (AppImage):** `chmod +x fdr.AppImage` then run it — no install
  needed.
- **Windows:** SmartScreen may flag the `.msi` — click "More info" → "Run
  anyway".

## License

See [LICENSE](LICENSE).

# Packaging

Food ships as a Tauri 2 desktop app and a static web export.

## Desktop (Tauri)

pnpm build # static export to out/ pnpm tauri build # platform bundles into
src-tauri/target/release/bundle/

CI builds every platform on pushes touching this app:

| Platform | Artifacts           |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| Linux    | `.AppImage`, `.deb` |
| macOS    | `.dmg` (aarch64)    |
| Windows  | `.msi` (x64)        |

Artifacts attach to the `app-hybrid-education-fdr-latest` release tag with
versions stripped from filenames; `SHA256SUMS.txt` accompanies them.

## Updater

`tauri.conf.json` points the updater plugin at the rolling release:

https://github.com/hieudoanm/hieudoanm.github.io/releases/latest/download/latest.json

Releases must be signed with the key whose public half is embedded in
`tauri.conf.json` (`pubkey`).

## Web

The site's root post-build script rebuilds each hybrid app with
`BASE_PATH=/downloads/<slug>` and copies `out/` to `docs/downloads/<slug>/`.

## Checklist

1. `pnpm test` green (coverage >= 80%)
2. `pnpm lint` clean
3. `pnpm build` exports without errors
4. Version bumped in `package.json` + `tauri.conf.json`
