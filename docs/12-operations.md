## Coding Conventions

- Arrow functions, `FC` type for components, `@/*` aliases
- DaisyUI component classes over bespoke CSS; theme tokens (`primary`,
  `secondary`, ...) from `themes.css`, no hardcoded colors
- Features are self-contained folders: pure logic in `utils.ts` (no React), UI
  in `index.tsx`. Pages never import feature internals besides the default
  export.
- Explicit types at boundaries; prefer interfaces for object shapes
- No comments unless explaining a non-obvious invariant

## Testing Conventions

- Break tests into small per-file suites: one `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` per
  unit (component, page, hook, util, provider), colocated in a `__tests__/`
  directory — never merge multiple units into one file.
- App pages are tested under `src/app/__tests__/` with a `*.test.tsx` matching
  each page (`page.test.tsx`, `error.test.tsx`, `not-found.test.tsx`); pages in
  route groups (`(app)`, `(info)`) colocate `__tests__/page.test.tsx` in the
  same folder.
- Jest treats every file inside `__tests__/` as a suite: keep shared fixtures in
  `<feature>/testing/`, not in `__tests__/`.
- Name tests as behaviour specs; pure utils get exhaustive edge-case tests;
  component tests assert user-visible output via Testing Library queries.
- Keep global coverage >= 80% — enforced by `jest.config.ts`
